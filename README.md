# Random Number Generator

Welcome to my first foray into developing a project with Xamarin. It was an interesting but tough experience I had, learning ad hoc to get the basic features and requirements done. 

This application takes in 2 integer numbers and creates a random list of integers at the bottom of the screen.

# Features
  - 2 boxes to enter the integers in
  - A scrollable window so you can scroll through all the randomly generate integers.
  - Basic error detection for user input. 
    a) The entry boxes glow red if the user's input is not an integer once the Generate button is pushed.
  
 # Missing
   -Unit testing. Unfortunately I keep running in errors due to the unit testing cannot load the Xamarin.Form.Core file.
   Something has to do with the config and app files.
